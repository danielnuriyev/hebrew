# Hebrew

A blog about the Hebrew language. I will present useful information for those who love our language and want to know it well. I assume at least basic knowledge of Hebrew. The blog itself will be mostly in English because it is also for non-fluent readers and for Jews living outside of Israel. I do not have much time but I will strive to continuously improve the existing articles and add new ones.
